#### Features
- Display your anime list from myanimelist.net in chrome's new tab
- Ability to change watched episodes
- Sets the finished date when you complete a show to today
- Sets the start date when you start watching a show

#### Planned Features
- Add settings for customization (backgrounds, colors Etc)
- Sort by airing. Shows which watching shows air next.

### Motivation
I personally am too lazy to go to myanimelist.net and update anime on my list. This is one step faster. Also it quickly shows me what shows i am watching and when the next episode airs

### Manually install the extension (unpacked)

[Download](https://github.com/ricklancee/new-tab-myanimelist/archive/master.zip) and unpack the zip files. Go to the chrome extension settings by typing in chrome://extensions/ in your address bar. Check the checkbox 'enable developer mode' and click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the `build/` folder inside the folder you just downloaded and unpacked. Open a new tab and login to your mal account.
